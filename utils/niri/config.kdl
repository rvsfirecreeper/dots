    // Output scale and rotation has to be taken into account for positioning:
    // outputs are sized in logical, or scaled, pixels.
    // For example, a 3840×2160 output with scale 2.0 will have a logical size of 1920×1080,
    // so to put another output directly adjacent to it on the right, set its x to 1920.

    // automatically.
