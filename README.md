## NOTICE

Please do not use these dotfiles unless you know what you're doing.
You are at risk of having to Rescue from TTY2 out of a mess.

PLEASE Do Not attempt to use Install.sh before you have a working OpenDoas config

##  Intro

Welcome to my dotfiles! Take whatever you like, but here are a few suggestions:

Use your own wallpaper.
I have a script for this that can import wallpapers into the folder for future use.

Modify monitors.conf and hyprpaper.conf to suit your own monitor.
I have a 165hz 1440p, but that's kinda niche.

## Install

You can use
`curl -sS https://gitlab.com/coolrustcoderguy/dots/-/raw/main/install.sh | bash`
for Artix or Arch Linux(maybe I ain't sure)

Or manually install all dependencies and use dotter deploy, but just don't.
The script isn't long, you can read it yourself.

## Note for Artix users

I'm too lazy to check but you probably need the extra repo enabled at minimum

## Doas

OpenDoas is required for install. I highly recommend using OpenDoas.
I may add doas-exclusive doas.conf rules in the future.
I already considered it for greetd background.
