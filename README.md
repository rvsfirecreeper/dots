First of all, know these are hyper personalized to my own hardware configuration. If you are using hyprland for the first time **please read the [wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org) and change `monitors.conf` to be appropriate for your setup. If you don't, you have a high chance of a black screen. Please read keybindings.conf because these are modified keybinds.**
 If you do that, its pretty nice rice. 
Oh btw this NEEDS pywal, pywal16 is preferred
