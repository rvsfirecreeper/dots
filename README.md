# Dots
## NOTICE:
## These dotfiles rely on Pywal16 heavily. Not pywal, pywal16. PLEASE Do Not attempt to use anything from here before:
* Installing pywal16
* running fullwal.sh(.config/hypr/scripts/fullwal.sh)
## These are also hardcoded for my monitors, please change the following: 
* `~/.config/hypr/scripts/fullwal.sh`
* `~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf`
## If you are using any init system aside from runit, please change ~/.config/hypr/autostart.conf to use systemctl
## If your distro does not show up automatically in the prompt, add it to ~/.config/starship.toml

Welcome to my dotfiles! Take whatever you like, but here are a few suggestions:
Use your own wallpaper. I have a script for this that can import wallpapers into the folder for future use.
Modify monitors.conf to suit your own monitor. I have a 165hz 1440p, but that's kinda niche.
