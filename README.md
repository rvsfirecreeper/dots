# Dots
## NOTICE:
These dotfiles rely on Pywal16 heavily. Not pywal, pywal16. PLEASE Do Not attempt to use anything from here before:
* Installing pywal16
* running fullwal.sh(.config/hypr/scripts/fullwal.sh)
Welcome to my dotfiles! Take whatever you like, but here are a few suggestions:
Use your own wallpaper. I have a script for this that can import wallpapers into the folder for future use.
Modify monitors.conf to suit your own monitor. I have a 165hz 1440p, but that's kinda niche.
